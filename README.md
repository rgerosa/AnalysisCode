Combine Package and ROOT 6
==========================

Please have a look to the following twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideHiggsAnalysisCombinedLimit#ROOT6_SLC6_release_CMSSW_7_4_X

=================================
Run Crab Jobs for a given dataset
=================================

Python multicrab script can be used to submit on multiple dataset in one shot

       cd AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/test/crab
       python <multicrab.py> <multicrab cfg> 

Examples on how to setup the python for data and MC are crab/multicrab_MC_76X.py crab/multicrab_DATA_76X.py:

	 pyCfgParams : list of all the parameters to be given to the cmsRun application when the job is executed on the grid
	 config.JobType.numCores : to allow multi-thread process .. the value should be the same of nThread
	 All the other parameters are the standard crab3 ones: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/CRAB3ConfigurationFile

The config file which defines the dataset and additional parmaters for the cmsRun application can be found in SampleList_DATA_76X and SampleList_MC_76X. 

    samples[<name of crab di>] = [<dataset name>, [<additional parameters>]]
    
Example: 

    samples['ZJetsToNuNu_HT-100To200']  = ['/ZJetsToNuNu_HT-100To200_13TeV-madgraph/RunIIFall15MiniAODv2-PU25nsData2015v1_76X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v12-v1/MINIAODSIM',
    					   ['useLHEWeights=True','addQCDPDFWeights=True','isSignalSample=False','addGenParticles=True','crossSection=280.5']]

=================================
Run Filter step for a dataset
=================================

The filter step macro allows to reduce the event content of the trees produced by the MonoJetTreeMaker, according to a set of predifined selections.

To run the macro:

       cd AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/;
       root -l ;
       .L fiters.C+
       sigfilter(...), zmmfilter(....), zeefilter(...), wmnfilter(...), wenfilter(...), gamfilter(...), topmufilter(...), topelfilter(...)

These function are used to select signal like events, Z->mm, Z->ee, W->mnu, W->enu, gamma+jets, semi-leptonic ttbar muon, semi-leptionc ttbar electron

Basic options:

      --inputFileName : name of the input file or name of the crab directory in which different files are locate (TChain is used in this case)
      --outputFileName : output file .. the code can take a list of files in input but will produce a single output
      --isMC : flag to indicate data or MC
      --applyBTagWeights : calculates b-tag scale factors and related uncertainties
      --isInputDirectory : specify if the inputFileName is a single file or a directory
      --isEOS : in case of a directoy this indicates if it is located in EOS or in a local directory
      --xsType: 0 means use the xsec branch stored in the origin MonoJetTreeMaker tree, 1 valuate the xs as sumwgt/Nevents (useful for powheg+minlo mono-jet samples), 2 means take the xs from LHE header stored in the genTree.
      --storeGenTree   : save the whole gen tree in the output 
      --isSinglePhoton : options available only for zeefilter, wenfilter and topelfilter allows to run on single photon dataset keeping events triggered by singlephoton but not by single electron triggers .. aim is to increase the statistics at high pt.
      --dropHLTFilter  : to drop the HLT selection during the filter stage --> useful for 80X MC
      --metCut : value to be applied on MET/Recoil

To run the filter step on a crab output:

       python scripts/runFilters.py -b <options>

Options:
	
	--inputDIR : input directory path
	--outputDIR : output directory path
	--filterName = "sigfilter",....... "all" => when you want to run all the filters (one filter = one job)
	--calculateXSfromSW : to calculate xs from sum of weights
	--calculateXSfromLHE : take xs from LHE header
	--isMC
	--applyBTagSF
	--storeGenTree
	--isSinglePhoton
	--isCrabDirectory : indicates if the directory has been created by crab (use a recursive find method to make the file list for the TChain)
	--isOnEOS
	--batchMode : means run the filter.C code on lxbatch
	--jobDIR : direcotry where all the jobs sh are created
	--queque <string>
	--submit : to submit while created
      	--dropHLTFilter 
        --metCut

Example:

	python scripts/runFilters.py --inputDIR /store/group/upgrade/delphes/VBS_SS/Production-03-04-2016//WWToLNuQQ_13TeV-powheg --outputDIR /store/group/upgrade/delphes/VBS_SS/Production-03-04-2016/SkimmedProduction-12-05-2016/ --filterName all --jobDIR JOB --queque 1nd --batchMode --submit --isOnEOS --isMC --applyBTagSF --isCrabDirectory 


==========================================
Run Filter step for all the crab outputs
==========================================

If you want to run in one shot filters on a set of outputs produced by crab for different datasets you can use:

      python scripts/submitFilters.py <options>

Options:

	--inputDIR : mother crab directory, typically located on EOS
	--outputDIR : output directory .. typically located on EOS
	<many options in common with scripts/runFilters.py>
	--grepName <name 1>,<name 2> ..: to look only at specific subdir which name contains all the string in the list
	--skipName <name 1>,<name 2> ..: to skip the sub-dir which name contains one  of the string in the list

Example:

	python scripts/submitFilters.py --inputDIR /store/group/upgrade/delphes/VBS_SS/Production-03-04-2016/ --outputDIR /store/group/upgrade/delphes/VBS_SS/Production-03-04-2016/SkimmedProduction-12-05-2016/ --filterName all --isMC --applyBTagSF --skipName MET,SinglePhoton,SingleEle --jobDIR JOB --queque 1nd

=================================
Copy Files to a local laptop
=================================

Once all the filtered files are available in some directory (typically on EOS), a script can be used to copy all or some of them to a local machine, where the last stages of the analysis are done:

     python scripts/files/copyAllDirectoriesEOS.py  <options>

Options:

	--inputDIR : mother direcotry where all the filtered files are located
	--outputDIR : local folder on a local machine
	--toEOS: in case the copy is not from EOS to a local machine but from a local machine to EOS
	--grepName name1,name2... : copy only a set of sub-dirs
	--skipName name1.name2... : skip some sub-dirs

Example:

	python scripts/files/copyAllDirectoriesEOS.py --inputDIR /store/group/upgrade/delphes/VBS_SS/Production-03-04-2016/SkimmedProduction-12-05-2016/ --outputDIR /home/rgerosa/test/ --grepName Axial,1000


To copy only files belonging to a single directory each time, please use: 

      python scripts/files/copyFilesEOS.py <options>     

=================================
Merge directories in a clever way
=================================

Once all the files are copied to a local machine, is a good thing to arrange them in common directories to run the last steps of the analysis. As example, if you have for Mono-jet Vector production 100 mass points, instead of keeping 100 directories, you can merge all the filter directories (sigfilter, zmmfilter..etc) into a common one. The output root file already reflects the name of the sample so there is no need of having indipendent directories (just the way in which crab is setup).

     python scripts/files/mergeDirectories.py <options>

Options:
	--inputDIR : mother directory that containes all the sub-directories that you wanna merge
	--outputDIR : name of the output common directory
	--grepName name1,name2... : merge only a	set of sub-dirs
	--skipName name1.name2... : skip some sub-dirs

Example:
	python scripts/files/mergeDirectories.py --inputDIR /home/rgerosa/test/ --outputDIR /home/rgerosa/test/DMV_Axial/ --grepName Axial


=================================
Merge ROOT files in a clever way
=================================

	python scripts/files/mergeFile.py <options>

Options:

	--inputDIR : directory that contains all the files to be merged
	--outputName : name of the single root file created

=======================================
Run Basic makeTemplate for the analysis
=======================================

After the filter step, once all the files are copied to a local machine and correctly organized in directories, these are the useful codes to run the analysis:

      cd AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/macros/makeTemplates/

      macros/makeTemplates/histoUtils.h : used to define the binning of each 1D observables as std::vector<float>. In addtion there are function usefult to smooth empty bins, make the average of two histograms, fix shape uncertainties, fix empty bins for combine and generate evenvelope given a set of input histograms

      macros/makeTemplates/histoUtils2D.h: same thing for 2D histograms .. this time there are also function to perform rolling and un-rolling (useful for a 2D analysis)

      macros/makeTemplates/makehist.h: function that makes the loop on the events, apply selections and weights. Some external files are useful here and located in the AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/data directory. baseInputTreePath is a string which indicated the base directory where all the input root files are located.

==========================
Create Combine Worksapce
==========================

The code to create the workspace assumes that all the templates for CRs and SR (background, data and signal) are located in a common file. In case signal templates have been produced independently from background ones, you can just hadd the templates*.root file. 


To run: make sure that the combine tool is properly installed in your CMSSW release

   	cd AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/macros/makeWorkspace/;
	root -l;
	gSystem->Load("$CMSSW_BASE/$SCRAM_ARCH/libHiggsAnalysisCombinedLimit.so")
	.L createWorksapce.C;
	createWorksapce.C(<option>);
   
Options:

	inputName : template file with all the histograms and TFs needed to build the workspace for the Likelihood model
	category  : same as in the makeTemplates .. used to retrive the right binning for the observable
	outputName : name of the output root file with the workspaces
	observable : 1D or 2D observable to be considered .. the code does a grep of a substring in the template file (2D are unrolled in 1D histo)
	isHiggsInvisible : produce signal templates for higgs invisible analysis (qqH, ggH, wH, zH and ggZH) .. if not monoJ, monoW, monoZ
	scaleQCD  : to scale the QCD background in the SR
	connectWZ : to use the W/Z link for the signal region
	connectTop : to link the top-enriched control sample .. not used in the baseline analysis and require to run the makeTemplate with addTop = True
	addShapeSystematics : add shape systematics for MC bkg and signal 
	mergeLeptons : to merge muon and electron control regions (useful as cross check)
	isCombination : naming convention used in HIG-16-016
	interaction : type of interaction in case of DM analysis
	mediatorMass : mass of the higgs boson in case of Higgs invisible, mediator mass for DM analysis
	DMMass : DM mass
	isCutAndCount : set to true when you want to produce a workspace for a cut and count analysis
	normalizeSignal: when doing a cut and count, you can decide to change the signal normalization to a reference value (typically 1 to extract model independent limit on the production cross section)
	xAxisSelection: in case of 1D templates, limits to be considered for the cut and count -> should match bin limits of the tempalte.root histograms
	yAxisSelection: to be set when performing a 2D analysis, i.e. a 1D un-rolled histograms derived from a 2D (y-axis range of integration for the cut and count)

There is an automatic script to produce all the workspace for all the signal mass points in one shot .. so that each worksapce can be use to run the limit since signal, data and backgroudn templates are there in each root file. 

To run the automatic production:

       cd AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/;
       python scripts/makeWorkspace.py <options>

Options:

	--inputDIR: working directory to be used .. typically the same directory in which the template file is located
	--outputDIR: output directory where all the workspaces will be copied (typically a directory on afs in the work area)
	--templateFile: name of the template file
	--category : same meaning as before
	--observable: observable to be considered
	--addShapeSystematics
	--connectWZ
	--connectTop
	--isHiggsInvisible
	--scaleQCD
	--mergeLeptons
	--isCombination
	--batchMode: to use lxbatch as scheduler
	--submit : to submit jobs
	--jobDIR:  directory to put the job executable.. must be accessible from the job itself so typically a directory in afs
	--queque: queque name on lxbatch
	--interaction: to run workspaces for all the mass combination of a given interaction ("Vector","Scalar","Pseudoscalar","Axial")
	--isCutAndCount: to produce a workspace for a cut and count analysis
	--normalizeSignal: absolute normalization of the singla for a cut and count analysis
	--xAxisSelection : x-axis extreme integration for cut and count
	--yAxisSelection : y-axis extreme integration for cut and count

The script works in the following way: 
1) make a list of all the TKey in the template file
2) try to recognize according to the template name the ones belonging to signal samples
3) If isHiggsInvisible: make one list for each production mode ggH, qqH, wH, zH and ggZH and submit one job per mass point (only common mass points are considered)
4) if not isHiggsInvisible: make a list of each production mode monoJ, monoW and monoZ for a given interaction and submit one job per mass point combination (mMED:mDM), only for common mass points.

Datacards Templates
===================

Datacards templates used for 2015 results (DM analysis, Higgs Invisible interpretation and combination) are available in the github area at this path: AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/cards. They are organized in different directories .. in particular:

	  AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/cards/HiggsInvisible : datacards used for Higgs invisible analysis. You cand find two subdirectories, monoJ contains datacards for the monoJet channel, monoV for the monoV(Vhad) one.
	  AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/cards/monoJet: datacards used for mono-jet channel DM results.
	  AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/cards/monoJet/onlyMonoJ --> fermion only datacards, in which only mono-jet signal is considered
	  AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/cards/monoJet/MonoJMonoV --> in the signal region, also contamintion from monoV(Vhad) signals is taken into account
	  AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/cards/monoJet/CutAndCount --> example cards to be used for a model-independent cross section limit

	  In each of the aforementioned directory, there are three sub-directories: noShapes means just lnN for b-tag and met systematics, Shapes means use a template morphing (shapeN2) for b-tagging, met sys (jes, jer and unclustered met) and bin-by-bin stat uncertainty for the signal has been added. Finally Top means datacards where two control regions are added (top-mu and top-el) to extract top background from data.



============================
Run combine jobs on lxbatch
============================

Automatic script can be found in AnalysisCode/MonoXAnalysis/scripts/runCombine.py

Options:

	--datacardDIR : directory where the datacard template to be used are located .. they are copied for each job into the job directory in order to substitute the dummy workspace name with the real one considered in the job
	--workspaceDIR: directory where all the workspace for each mMED/mDM mass points are located
	--jobDIR      : in case the script is run in batch mode, jobDIR is the mother directory where job configuration files are located (as well as datacards and workspaces)
	--category    : as usual, == 0 is monoV+monoJet combination, == 1 is mono-jet exclusive, == 2 is monoV(had)
	--interaction : string to indicate "Vector", "Axial", "Scalar","PseudoScalar"
	--dmMass      : mDM value
	--medMass     : mediator mass
	--batchMode   : to allow lxbtach submission mode
	--queque      : queque on lxbatch to be used when submitting jobs
	--submit      : to submit jobs
	--ntoys       : number of toys to be run 
	--submitOneJobPerToy : one toy == one job .. in particular can be useful when doing bias studies to speed up
	--expectSignal  : inject a signal strenght in the toy
	--toyGeneration : type of toy --> 0 mean frequentist toy (post-fit nuisances from data), 1 means stat only toy a-priori, 2 means a-priori stat+sys toys
	--crossedToys   : means to use the dataset generated by another toy, probably produced by an alternative model (for un-binned analysis)
	--inputGeneratedDataset : generated dataset to be used in the fit/limit/significance computation are stored in a different directory
	--Asymptotic    : run Asymptotic limit evaluation
	--runBlind      : to run blind limit (from pre-fit background estimate)
	--runExpected   : to run just expected limit evaluation
	--generateOnly  : use the toy generator in combine to produce a pseudo-data genaration	
	--MaxLikelihoodFit : max likelihood s+b and b-only fit in combine
	--MultiDimFit   : multi-dimensional fit in combine
	--rMin          : min r-value bound
	--rMax          : max r-value bound
	--ProfileLikelihood : to be used for significance and p-value computation
	--pvalue        : compute p-value instead of significance
	--makeLikelihoodScan : use MultiDimFit for a Likelihood scan		
	--outputDIR     : output directory where the .root file from combine are located. One root file per job, i.e. one file per mass point. Inside the limit tree the mH branch is fixed to re-flect the mass point, using the following convention: (Vector = 1, Axial = 2, Scalar = 3, PseudoScalar = 4, Higgs Invisible = 5), medMass (4digits), dmMass (4digits). The output dir is created as a subdirectory of the workspaceDIR
	--calculateStatOnly: calculate stat only limits or significance (to be used together with --ProfileLikelihood and --Asymptotic) .. this cannot be done with -S 0 with RooParametric hists
	--inputSnapShotDIR: directory where snapshot fit file from multiDIM fit are stored
